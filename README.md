Hello! Welcome to Skateful, by badri narayan

this app was made for my first capstone project at Thinkful.

The goal for this app is to upload custom skater profiles and compete to see which skater gets the most up-votes.
Users can also comment on each skater, and have discussion if they'd like!

You can register for a new account, or you can log-in to the admin profile using the credentials: 'admin', 'password'
or to see how regular accounts work, you can create your own or log in using 'badri', 'password'

The components can be re-used for other purposes as well, simply re-name the fields accordingly.
The Card component iterates through the CardsList component, ie the Cards are in the CardsList
The NewCard Component Creates a new Card.

All of the Components are organized as best as I could, separated in different folders, each containing their appropriate .css files. Some general CSS (CSS that doesn't  carries over the other components. 

Tech Stack: PERN, Testing: Chai, Jest, Mocha
